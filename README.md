# canvas-snake

*This is the first part of a long-term project I have been working on, where I work on a new project every week (to the best of my abilities). This was the project I worked on from **February 11th** to **February 17**.

This project was entirely made using the HTML canvas element in combination with Javascript. I decided to make this snake game as an introduction to HTML canvas and an easy work-in to the "new project every week" thing, because it had been a while since I had worked with HTML/JS but I still wanted to try something somewhat new.

## Controls

- `WASD` control snake movement
- `Space`pauses

## TODO:

- Fix some minor bugs
- Use Github Pages for hosting
